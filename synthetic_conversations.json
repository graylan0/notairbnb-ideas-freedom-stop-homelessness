    "Conversation 1: Customer: 'I'm interested in booking your place for a couple of months, but I might need to extend my stay. What's your policy on long-term stays and late check-outs?' Host: 'Normally, I require a month's notice for long-term stays. Late check-outs depend on the booking schedule. Can I ask the reason for the extension?' Customer: 'I'm not sure yet, just exploring my options. Also, can we deal with the payment outside the platform to avoid extra fees?'",
    "Conversation 2: Customer: 'I saw your listing and I love it! However, I'm on a tight budget. Can we strike a deal off this platform? I can pay cash.' Host: 'I'm sorry, but all transactions need to go through the platform for both our safety and insurance purposes.' Customer: 'Oh come on, we can both benefit from avoiding service fees. Think about it and let me know.'",
    "Conversation 3: Customer: 'I'm thinking of hosting a small event at your place. It won't be anything big, just a few friends. Is that okay?' Host: 'I'm sorry, but my policy strictly prohibits hosting events or parties of any size to ensure the peace and safety of the neighborhood.'",
    "Conversation 4: Customer: 'Your place looks great, but the price is a bit high. Can I pay you half through the platform and half in cash to get a discount?' Host: 'Unfortunately, I can't offer discounts outside the platform's payment system. All payments must be made in full through the platform for security reasons.'"

We do ask that guests keep noise levels down after 10 PM to respect other residents.'"
